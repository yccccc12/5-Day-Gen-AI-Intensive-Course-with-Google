This is a critical foundational step in drug discovery, and AI is making a significant impact here.\n\nLet's dive deeper into what this entails and why AI is so revolutionary:\n\n**What is Target Identification and Validation?**\n\n*   **Target Identification:** This is the process of finding a specific molecule (usually a protein, but can also be RNA or DNA) in the body that is involved in a disease. The idea is that by modulating the activity of this \"target\" (e.g., inhibiting an overactive enzyme, activating a deficient receptor), you can treat or prevent the disease.\n*   **Target Validation:** Once a potential target is identified, it needs to be validated. This means confirming that the target is indeed crucial for the disease's progression and that modulating it will have a beneficial effect without causing unacceptable side effects.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\n\nThe traditional methods for identifying targets were often laborious, time-consuming, and sometimes serendipitous. AI changes this by enabling:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **The Challenge:** Modern biological research generates vast amounts of data from different \"omics\" layers:\n        *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences and variations.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** RNA levels, showing which genes are being actively transcribed.\n        *   **Proteomics:** Protein levels and their modifications, representing the functional machinery of the cell.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** Small molecules (metabolites) involved in cellular processes.\n        *   **Epigenomics:** Modifications to DNA that affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI algorithms, particularly machine learning, are excellent at finding patterns and correlations within these massive, heterogeneous datasets. They can:\n        *   **Identify differentially expressed genes/proteins:** Find molecules that are significantly up- or down-regulated in diseased tissue compared to healthy tissue.\n        *   **Uncover gene-disease associations:** Link specific genetic variations to an increased risk of certain diseases.\n        *   **Map complex biological networks:** Understand how different molecules interact and influence each other in disease pathways. AI can help pinpoint key \"bottlenecks\" or \"drivers\" in these networks that could serve as effective targets.\n        *   **Integrate data from multiple sources:** Combine data from patient samples, research studies, and public databases to build a more comprehensive picture.\n\n2.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Literature Mining:**\n    *   **The Challenge:** A colossal amount of biomedical research is published every year, making it impossible for humans to keep up with all the relevant findings.\n    *   **AI's Role:** NLP-powered AI can scan millions of scientific papers, patents, and clinical trial reports to extract information about genes, proteins, diseases, and their relationships. It can:\n        *   **Identify emerging trends:** Spot novel associations between molecules and diseases that might not be immediately obvious.\n        *   **Connect disparate pieces of information:** Link findings from different studies that, when combined, point to a promising new target.\n        *   **Summarize existing knowledge:** Provide researchers with concise summaries of what is known about a particular gene or disease.\n\n3.  **Predicting Druggability:**\n    *   **The Challenge:** Identifying a target is only half the battle. You need to know if it's \"druggable\" – meaning if a small molecule or antibody can effectively bind to it and modulate its function.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI models can be trained on data of known druggable and non-druggable targets to predict the likelihood that a newly identified target will be amenable to drug development. This involves analyzing its structural features, evolutionary conservation, and known interactions.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Validation:**\n\nValidation ensures that the identified target is truly relevant to the disease. AI contributes by:\n\n1.  **Computational Modeling and Simulation:**\n    *   AI can build sophisticated computational models of cellular processes or disease pathways. By simulating the effect of \"knocking out\" or \"overexpressing\" a particular target within these models, researchers can predict its impact on disease phenotypes.\n\n2.  **Biomarker Discovery:**\n    *   AI can identify specific biomarkers (measurable indicators) that correlate with the activity of a target and the presence of a disease. The presence or absence of these biomarkers can then be used to validate the target's role.\n\n3.  **\"In Silico\" Perturbation Studies:**\n    *   Similar to simulations, AI can guide \"in silico\" experiments that mimic experimental perturbations (like gene silencing or drug treatment) to assess the predicted downstream effects on disease markers.\n\n**Key Benefits of AI in Target Identification & Validation:**\n\n*   **Speed:** AI can analyze data and identify potential targets orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.\n*   **Comprehensiveness:** AI can process and integrate information from vastly larger and more diverse datasets than humans can.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can uncover non-obvious relationships and identify novel targets that might have been missed by human researchers.\n*   **Reduced Cost:** By identifying more promising targets earlier and weeding out less viable ones, AI can significantly reduce the cost of the initial stages of drug discovery.\n\nThis development is foundational because a faulty or invalid target will lead to wasted effort and resources in the subsequent stages of drug development. AI's ability to sift through immense complexity and find meaningful biological signals is making it an indispensable tool for uncovering the next generation of therapeutic targets.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven target identification and validation is diverse, encompassing a mix of AI-native biotech startups, established pharmaceutical giants, and technology providers.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
