# 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google

Google × Kaggle | 10 - 14 November 2025

## Overview
This 5-day online course was crafted by Google’s ML researchers and engineers to help developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents. This repository served to save the notebook, course materials and resources for this course. 

Course Goals:
- Understand AI Agent Foundations – Learn the core concepts, structures, and behaviors that define intelligent, autonomous agents.
- Integrate Tools & Interoperability (MCP) – Enable agents to act using external tools, APIs, and the Model Context Protocol for real-time interaction.
- Implement Context & Memory – Build agents that remember and use past information to handle multi-turn, contextual tasks effectively.
- Ensure Agent Quality & Reliability – Apply evaluation, observability, and performance metrics to build dependable AI agents.
- Deploy Production-Ready Agents – Transition from prototypes to scalable, multi-agent systems using deployment best practices and the A2A protocol.

## Agenda
### Day 1 (Introduction to Agents)
Explore the foundational concepts of AI agents, their defining characteristics, and how agentic architectures differ from traditional LLM applications, laying the groundwork for building intelligent, autonomous systems.

Today’s whitepaper introduces **AI agents**, outlining their core capabilities, the importance of Agent Ops for reliability and governance, and the need for interoperability and security through identity and policy constraints. In the codelabs, first AI agent and a multi-agent system are build using the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** powered by Gemini, enabling real-time Google Search integration and teamwork between specialized agents.

### Day 2 (Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP))
Dive into the world of tools, understanding how AI agents can "take action" by leveraging external functionalities and APIs, and explore the ease of discovering and using tools offered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Today’s whitepaper focuses on **external tool functions** that enable agents to perform actions or access **real-time data** beyond their training set. It introduces **best practices** for designing effective tools and explores the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — covering its architectural components, communication layer, associated risks, and enterprise readiness gaps.

- [Explore](Day-2/day-2b-agent-tools-best-practices.ipynb) best practices for tools, including using MCP and long-running operations.

### Day 3: Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory
Explore how to build AI agents that can remember past interactions and maintain context. Learn how to implement short-term and long-term memory to create more robust agents capable of handling complex, multi-turn tasks.

### Day 4: Agent Quality
Learn to build robust and reliable AI agents by mastering the critical disciplines of evaluating and improving agents. This session will cover observability, logging, and tracing to provide visibility, alongside key metrics and evaluation strategies to optimize agent performance.

### Day 5: Prototype to Production 
Go beyond local testing and learn to deploy and scale AI agents for real-world use. This session will cover the best practices for deploying your agents so that others can use them, including how to create a truly multi-agent system with the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.
